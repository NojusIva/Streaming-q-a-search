Hey, I am calling to ask some questions about some issues I have been having with my migraines.
It is getting to the point where it is almost impossible to fall asleep at night.
The pain is very harsh, and I am taking Ibuprofen to handle it.
I fear that I might need to take stronger drugs because Ibuprofen doesnt always work for me.
What should I do? What medicine would you recommend for me?
