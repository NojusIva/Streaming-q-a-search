Hello, my name is Alice. I'm calling from Chicago and want to ask some questions.
I'm pregnant for 6 months now, but I'm not telling anyone about this.
I have periodic headaches.
When I work, I feel like my ability to concentrate is being hindered by them.
It's already hard to work from 9 to 5 every day, God, and now this.
My mom told me about this wonder drug called paracetamol. She assumed me that it would help me a lot.
I'm not sure if that is okay. It's not like I'm a specialist in this field or anything so I decided to call here to be sure just in case.
Can I use this medicine safely and will it help me?
